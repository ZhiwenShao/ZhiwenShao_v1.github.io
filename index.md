## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="zhiwen.png">

I am now a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, advised by Prof. Lizhuang Ma. My research interests lie in face analysis and deep learning, in particular, face alignment and facial expression recognition.

## News

I am now studying at Multimedia and Interactive Computing Lab of Nanyang Technological University as a research assistant, advised by Prof. Jianfei Cai.
